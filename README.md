SDENet as Uncertainty Quantification Method for EEG Source Localization


In this study, we used the Neural Stochastic Differential Equations Network (SDENet), a combination of dynamical system and deep learning techniques that utilizes the Wiener process to minimize conductivity uncertainties in the volume conductor models (VCMs) and improve the inverse problem.
