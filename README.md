# SDENet as Uncertainty Quantification Method for EEG Source Localization


In this study, we used the Neural Stochastic Differential Equations Network (SDENet), a combination of dynamical system and deep learning techniques that utilizes the Wiener process to minimize conductivity uncertainties in the volume conductor models (VCMs) and improve the inverse problem. The SDENet uses deep learning with a stochastic differential equation (SDE) component. It is mathematically expressed as $$ \text{d}\mathbf{X} = f(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{t})\text{d}\mathbf{t} + g(\mathbf{X}, \mathbf{t})\text{d}\mathbf{W} $$ where the function $f$ determines the mean of uncertainty generated by $X$, and function $g$ determines the variance (i.e., uncertainty).
